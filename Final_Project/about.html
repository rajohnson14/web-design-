        <h1>Overview of the Harry Potter Books </h1>
        <p>The story follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who learns of his magical heritage on his 11th birthday. Harry’s life changes forever when he receives an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a magical boarding school filled with wonder, mystery, and danger. Alongside his loyal friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, Harry navigates the challenges of growing up while uncovering the secrets of his past and battling the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who seeks to dominate the wizarding and non-magical worlds.

            Each book corresponds to one school year at Hogwarts, chronicling Harry’s journey from a naïve boy to a courageous hero destined to confront Voldemort in an epic battle.</p>
