    <h1>"Magic of Hogwarts</h1>
    <p>"Hogwarts is divided into four houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin—each with its own values and personalities. The Sorting Hat assigns each new student to a house based on their traits. Hogwarts isn’t just a school; it's where the characters grow, form friendships, and discover who they are meant to be. With its enchanted ceiling in the Great Hall, ghostly residents like Nearly Headless Nick, and vast Forbidden Forest, Hogwarts is a magical place readers never forget."</p>
